        <h1> NEW PAGEEE BABYYYYYYYY</h1>
    </nav>
    <a href="./dashing.html"> <p> to go back idiot ;^</p></a>
    <p> new command, this time its form, basically to make a sign in form, NO LOGIC able, its a popup i believe, use alternative coding to make it work</p>
    <p> control + right arrow key is easy skip to end, also label = a text heading for the form thingy :^, and input text for inputting text self explained</p>
    <p> for label, add 'for=""' for name effect purposes for now till i update it on form, but its inline meaning same line so use to literally label stuff, for the input use 'type="' to add a text input like python input ;^ does nothing without code tho-
     so email makes the input form check for an @ sign and an ., password type makes it hidden as per the name
    number is the same game as its name, it requires a number this time, Date makes you put in a date, and gives a panel to boot as well
    IF YOU ADD required AFTER type command, it makes it REQUIRED to use the submit button upon i.e the email name</p>
    <div><form>
    <label for=""> Email :^ or something</label>
    <input type="text" required>
    </div><div><label for=""> passworddd :^ or something</label>
    <input type="password"></div>
    <div><label>AGE</label><input type="age"></div>
    <div><label>BIRTHDATE</label><input type="date"></div>
    <button> Submit</button>

    <p> NEW text INPUT thing, rather than input command, use this, aka textarea, and you can add rows="" to get an actual box size, same thing as the rest, its basically an input  you can also drag it ;^;^</p>
    <textarea rows="5"></textarea>
    <p> ok so new command but neeeds other coding languages to operate :^ the spannn comand :^ > and span = this, what it does is allow you to TARGET it and code it ;^withfontstuff like colour size and stuff;^</p>
    <p> and yet another command, the hr command, it makes a horizontal line in its position :^:^:^:^</p>
    <hr>
    </form>
