    <h1> L bozoth, but basically all html code is using the greater than signs to close out like parenthesis</h1>
    <p>but why? forward slash is the closing of line codes rather than new line</p>
    <h6> yo im so fucking small, but h1 and the less than greater signs, through h6 is a smaller font size the higher the number</h6>
    <p> so do not use 'lorem' makes to many words if you type 'lorem + number' but generates shit</p>
    <p> so basically block elements = coding named term that refers to stuff that takes up all the space available, such as the title command thingy, it takes the whole verticle area.</p>
    <p> so basically inline is the block element but it only takes the space needed and not always a full page space</p>
    <button>so uh idkkkkk</button> <b> so this is showcasing inline lol, but the b in > signs is basically the bolding of characters</b>
    <div><b> it doesnt need a new line i think even [b] [it doesnt] </b></div>
    <p> so uh the div command is basically the indent or the /n i think in python</p>
    <div>
    <p> so to showcase a grouping cause div can apparently group together or make them related, here we go</p>
    <p> welcome waluigi entrent here we areeeeeeee</p>
    <p> you should use the fucking inspect tool to look</p>
    <p> but idk mate you are the worst</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>but see?</p>
    <p> its simple :^</p>
    </div>
    <p><i> so we have fancy words, this time simply 'i' is the way for ittallics or something</i></p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4PF1vfbarE"> <p>sooo the A command, its different, you need to type a normal comand like the p in > thingies, but before you write > in the finish,
    what you want to do is type href="" and in quotes your link, but there wont be shit, so you gotta inbetween the / closing a, you have to put words, which will be the links showcased name like the one here :^</p></a>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6DrpRroko" target="_blank"><p> so how do we get it to be in a new tab? without updating the current page, think of the middle mouse click rather than left click, well simply, add this command, target="_blank" after the link input part of the command to the thing :^ and thatll do it for you</p></a>
    <p>so uh do note they are LINKS imbeded, so you need basic web addressing, like https://, or www. stuff, :^:^:^::^:^ </p>
    <a href="dashing.html"> <p> so it works, but only if you order it with the linker being main domain, and not move it, and have the thing autocomplete file location lol but yeah put /filename.fileextension for it in href for the thingy to link to your file like a webpage</p></a>
    <p> use link for new page idiot ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
