      <a href="./aaindex.html" target="_blank">
        <p>
          I THINK I GOT IT, so you have to link the FILE tree, for me who put my
          files for html in a folder named dashboard, i have to
          /dashboard/filename.html it :^ for it to work, for linking in href so
          yeah do that to link back to your own files :^ ALSO, ./ TELLS it to look in a file location, so the file main root the /Dashboard/aaindex.html thingy can also be done with ./aaindex
        </p></a>
    </nav>
    <main> 
        <section>
            <div>
                <p>
                    so we are doing lists now, ul stands for unstructured list think of it
                    like a div, but with it you can use the Li command to make little list
                    points MUST BE INSIDE THE UL
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>list point 1 ;^</li>
                    <li>
                        list point 2 ay ;^ all this does so far with just this is make bullet
                        points :^ also with ul the list doesnt matter what order, but we can
                        order it with this next one :^
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>so uh list 2 with order babyyyyy</h1>
                <p>
                    basically use the ol instead of ul, standing for ordered list to make it
                    ordered
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> so basically same command, use li for list point ;^ k</li>
                    <li> this time it numbers not just bullet points it :^</li>
                    <p> it is in fact automatic sequencing so yeahhhhhh python > htmlllllll :^</p>
                    <li> tho i think i can surround it which is cool ;> [i.e use p command inbetween li's]</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>
        <footer>
            <p> so basically nav = start div explanation pending, and footer is for the end ;^ like right here</p>
            <p> so basically a section is another like nav or footnote, its a sectioner or as far as i have it, another div</p>
            <p> pretty sure this is for formatting so you can read it in html easier ya know</p>
            <p> IMAGE TIME, so img is the command and it needs the src="" and alt="", basically src = the where it looks for the file so put that there, and alt = if image doesnt show it shows this instead with text describing it</p>
            <p> externally = copy paste image link online for it some images dont work???? but waluigi my king works</p>
            <p> for internal, think of it like prior files, you have it downloaded and stuff, you simply link it rather than url but with file extension, so /Dashboard/filename.stuff, or ./ item name, you have to drag it in for this coding site, and pretty sure thats how it works normally :^ </p>

            <div>
            <img src="./imagery/epistellar_horizon.jpg" alt=" :^ idk mate its broken">
            <p> so uh USE THE FUCKING PREBUILT links..[auto suggestion links :^] it breaks if you type it manually, damn skill haters</p>
            </div>
            <p>TEST IDEA image link ;^ with indentures :^:^:^:^:^:^</p>
            <div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obYxd5muDIs"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ7eh6Efa_QEJDURVwSixXfsWIJYJh5bL4tkjjw8VMxv2OueFYycf-yhGgaRjB4KPQm-plHZFZd3uZVwh-Zbp--OUC_z87KQyHoIwyhAvA" alt=""></a></div>
            <p>yes it worksssss :^:^:^:^:^:^ tldr embed them all in the same line :^ div then link then image :^ BY the way ./ ONLY searches WITHIN the same folder, so use carefully when relocating, use .. or so dots to go BACK a file, so basically one . = same folder, .. = file HIGHEr than it, or prior :^</p>
